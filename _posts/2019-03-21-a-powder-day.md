# Wtf?

The beginning of this adventure took place during a trip to Austria with my friend Edoardo. We were traveling by car on the Brenner motorway towards Scmirtal, when suddenly I get an Instagram message from Fischersport:
~~~ 
Hello Flavio, many thanks for applying to the Fischer Transalp 2018 - we are pleased to inform you that you will be joining us on the upcoming tour :)
~~~ 
I almost forgot (sorry), I couldn't believe it, the blindfolded goddess looked back at me ... now I have to start getting ready, this is a unique opportunity :)

The rest of the day was unforgettable
