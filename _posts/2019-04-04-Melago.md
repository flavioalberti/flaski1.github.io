# Day 2 (on the way to the Sesvenna Hutte)

Bad weather arrived earlied than expected, but did not create so much complications. Yesterday, under a light snowfall, we crossed the long valley that leads to S-Charl's village, a jewel in the Swiss Alps, and then we climbed to the Sesvenna hut. These long valleys are terrible, very often they have long distances with slight slope, where people that have good skating technique have an advantage :(
From S-Charl we climbed towards the Sevenna fork, but gave up the summit because of the weather (very windy with persistent fog).
I know the region enough, but I have to say that it was not easy at all to find the way in those weather conditions, and we had to trust on the gps guides and gps track

# Day 3 (snow, fog and wind)

Today, as expected, we are under a snow storm with a strong wind. The idea of ​​going down to Resia through the Rasass piz was correct discarded ... Than the Alpine Guides led us down to Slingia and then we all move by car to the San Valentino's ski-area where we put the skins back on and we went up to the piz Watleskopft, a easy summit, neverthanless with today's weather conditions it has created us various problems.
After freezing in the wind at the top, we skied down to the cars park, then we headed to Melago in an amazing Hotel with spa :)
Now there are 20cm of new snow and it doesn't seems to stop. For tomorrow we planned a long tour to the Vernago refuge (AT) for reaching Wildspitze on saturday morning... But we will discover if the plan will became true only after the night. :)
