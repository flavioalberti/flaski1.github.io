I'd like to quickly review the equipment that fischersport gave me for the transalp 2019

# Hannibal 96

When the emphasis is on enjoying the downhill, Hannibal is the ideal freeride tourer. With its low weight it is one of the lightest in its category, enabling effortless climbs leading to the highlight: the perfect downhill, thanks to its perfect shape.

Freeride tourer for awesome downhill enjoyment
The Hannibal is genius when it comes to the downhill ride. Thanks to its 100mm width it offers ideal float in any snow. Its stability guarantees fun, safety, and a superior downhill performance.

Ingenious lightweight for effortless climbs
The Hannibal is a lightweight in its category. Despite optimum width for the downhill ride and Sandwich Sidewall Construction, the ski is ideal for the climb thanks to its low weight. This is made possible by the Air Tec Ti construction.

Outstanding shape
The Aeroshape construction of the Hannibal is a clear strength. It makes for easy-going skiing in all terrain. With this ski you can enjoy perfect turns in powder.


# Travers Carbon

One turn for the perfect fit! Perfect closure pressure distribution thanks to the Lace Frame System and Pulley Guides. The Active Cuff offers a foot rotation of over 80 degrees in walk mode during the climb and perfect power transfer in the downhill ride thanks to Grilamid. 980 g (26,5).

*Lace Frame System*
The new type of tongue construction combined with a roller-operated Boa® Closure System enables stepless boot adjustment. Closing forces are distributed evenly around the entire foot and can be easily adjusted using one hand.

*Active Cuff – more efficiency when climbing*
The special cuff construction enables a previously unattained rotation angle of over 80° for optimum freedom of movement. Make progress with every step you take.

*No-Torsion base – Maximum performance when skiing downhill*
The carbon/aramid plate used in the sole section ensures maximum torsional stiffness. Ideal for a controlled and perfect downhill experience.
