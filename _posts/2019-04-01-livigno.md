Yesterday has been a long day. Traveled all the night along Austria, to arrive at 5:00 in Ried,the headquarters of the FischerSport, to attempt the official presentations, do the hardware check and the visit the factory where the ski have been made ... fantastico. In the afternoon we've loaded all the luggage and we set off for a long transfer to Livigno, the starting point of our first tour.
The participants are amazing, all young guys and girls from various parts of the world, full of energy, friendly and with a great passion for ski mountaineering ... everyone has his specialty, there are professional photographers,ski instructors, mountaineers and simple people like me that like to ski :)

What about today: we can say that the beginning has been quite intense, we took a long tour starting from the pass "tre palle" (ITA), to arrive in Val Mustair (CH), 27km of tour with about 1300m of ascent. On the tour we've found overall good conditions, slightly variable weather, sunshine and even a bit of snow towards the end ... the weather sounds be good also for tomorrow, so we are preparing for an other long trip along the S.carl valley and later climbing up to the piz. Sesvenna where we sleep in a the nice hut.
