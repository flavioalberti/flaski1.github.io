Busy day, certainly challenging for me, and the alarm rings again at 4:00, also if I have to be in Brenner by 11:00 pm ...
A nice tour has been planned for today with some friends of the skialpcai, so I reach them (Mauro, Igino and Francesco) in Madonna di Campiglio, to do together the "traverse of Cima Brenta", the spectacular and iconic peak of Dolomiti di Brenta. The tour is intense, but we have in front of us a sunny day with no wind, the best conditions for this traverse. 10 hours of pains and breathtaking views, but it was worth it....
Now I'm here in Brennero train station, exhausted but happy, waiting my train to Ried,  because tomorrow is an other day, but right now I only want to sleep :)
