Intense day, and definitely challenging for me when the alarm goes off again at 4:00 ...
A nice tour was scheduled for today in the Brenta group with some friends of the skialpcai. I reach Mauro, Igino and Francesco in Madonna di Campiglio, one of the best ski areas, but our goal is Cima Brenta in traverse, a spectacular and iconic peak of the Dolomites. The tour is intense, but we have a sunny day without wind, the best conditions to do this. 10 hours of pain, sharp ridge and breathtaking views, but it was worth it ....
Now I'm here in Brenner station, exhausted but happy, waiting for my train to Ried, because tomorrow is another day, but right now I just want to sleep :(
