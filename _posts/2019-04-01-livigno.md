Yesterday has been a long day. Traveled all the night along Austria, to arrive at 5:00 in Ried,the headquarters of the FIscherSport, to attempt the official presentations, do the hardware check and the visit the factory where the ski have been made ... fantastico. In the afternoon we've loaded all the luggage and we set off for a long transfer to Livigno, the starting point of our first tour.
The participants are fantastic people, all young guys and girls from various parts of the world, full of energy, friendly and with a great passion for ski mountaineering ... everyone has his specialty, there are professional photographers, ski instructors, mountaineers and simple people like me :)
