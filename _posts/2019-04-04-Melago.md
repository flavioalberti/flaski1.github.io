# Day 2 (on the way to the Sesvenna Hutte)

Bad weather came before forecasts, but did not create so much complications. Yesterday, under a light snowfall, we crossed the long valley that leads to the village of S-Charl, a jewel in the Swiss Alps, and then we climbed to the Sesvenna hut. These long valleys are terrible, very often they have long stretches on a slight slope, and those who have a good skating technique have an advantage :(
From S-Charl we climbed towards the Sevenna fork, but gave up on the summit because of the weather (wind and persistent fog).
I know the region enough, but I have to say that it was not easy at all to find the way in those conditions, and we had to trust on the gps guides and gps track

# Day 3 (snow, fog and wind)

Today, as expected, we are under a snow storm with strong wind. The idea of ​​going down to Resia through the Rasass piz was rightly discarded ... The guides then made us get off at Slingia and then move by car to the San Valentino ski-area where we put the skins back on and went up to the piz Seekhopfl, a simple top, but with today's conditions has created us different problems.
After freezing in the wind at the top, we got soaked to the cars, heading towards Melago in a fatal Hotel with a spa :)
Now it is snowing hard, tomorrow we should wait for a long walk from the Vernago refuge (AT), to go up the next day to the WildSpitze ... but this will only be discovered tomorrow morning.
